            <h3>Informed consent</h3>
            <p>We are members of a research project called Feed4Food. We aim to empower vulnerable communities in three European cities—Greece, Cyprus, and Romania—through our innovative Urban Agriculture Living Labs. We hope to learn more about good and bad practices when establishing and running urban agriculture living labs.  The information obtained from this study may benefit others who want to establish similar urban agriculture living labs in the future. In this project, we would like to evaluate the impact of the Living Labs on specific aspects of participants’ life: health and quality of life. The aim is to investigate what can facilitate sustainable, inclusive and healthy urban food environments. We would therefore like you to answer a series of questionnaires, as well as to regularly input information on your activities in the urban garden you maintain.  </p>
            
            <p>We would like to emphasize that the questionnaires are completely anonymous and no identifying information will be collected. Your answers will be purely used for research purposes and will not affect any benefit or subsidies you may receive now or in the future. All data provided will be stored on Yoda, a storage platform provided by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam that operates in full accordance with the European Union privacy rules. Data from this study may be shared through Yoda with the research community at large to advance science. </p>
            
            <p>Taking part in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate before the study begins or discontinue your participation at any time. You may skip any question that might make you feel uncomfortable or distressed, with no penalty.  Please state the user name that you use for connecting to the dashboard portal if you wish to withdraw your participation during or after the study.  We do not anticipate any risks from participating in this research.
